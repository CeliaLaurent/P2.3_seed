## Final Project starting from step-35

This additional work consists in the transformation of the step-35 code, leaving aside the shared-memory parallelization (workstream), and concentrating on the following objectives:

- [ ] replacement of the deal-II linear algebra by the Trilinos library
- [ ] implementation of the MPI parallelization 

The report of this work is in the file [project/readme.md](project/step-35.md) and source code is in directory [project/step-35/](project/step-35)
